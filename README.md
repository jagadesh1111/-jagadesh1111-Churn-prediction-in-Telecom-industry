# Churn-prediction-in-Telecom-industry
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunication industry. Churn refers to the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their services or switching to competitors. By identifying potential churners, telecom companies can take proactive measures to retain customers and minimize revenue loss. In this project, we analyze a telecom dataset and build predictive models to forecast customer churn.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the telecommunication industry. It contains information about customers, their demographics, services used, tenure, and churn status. The dataset is stored in a CSV file and is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies (pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
## Usage
1. Load the dataset: df = pd.read_csv('telecom_dataset.csv')
2. Preprocess the data:
   - Handle missing values and data type conversion.
   - Transform categorical variables into dummy variables.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
      - Visualize data distributions, correlations, and customer demographics.
      - Analyze factors related to churn and customer behavior.
4. Predictive Modeling:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Build and evaluate predictive models, such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.
   - Assess model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, we analyze various aspects of the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and churn patterns. We explore factors such as gender distribution, seniority levels, contract types, service usage, and customer dependencies.

## Predictive Modeling
To predict customer churn, we employ machine learning algorithms. We build and evaluate predictive models using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines. These models are trained on the dataset and tested on unseen data to assess their performance in predicting churn.

## Results
After training and evaluating the models, we calculate their accuracy and examine the feature importance. We analyze factors that contribute most to churn and identify patterns that influence customer retention.

## Conclusion
Based on the results of our analysis and predictive models, we gain insights into the factors that drive customer churn in the telecommunication industry. These insights can help telecom companies devise targeted strategies to reduce churn, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance customer retention.
