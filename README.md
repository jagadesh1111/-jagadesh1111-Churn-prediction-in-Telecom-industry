# Churn-prediction-in-Telecom-industry
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunication industry. Churn refers to the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their services or switching to competitors. By identifying potential churners, telecom companies can take proactive measures to retain customers and minimize revenue loss. In this project, we analyze a telecom dataset and build predictive models to forecast customer churn.
